## Phase I
## Phase II: Model Transits / Accessibilities
1. Regard the moment when a state transition happens as the moment when a need occurs (Need for short-term stay, Nursing, long-term stay, house or go home).
1. Create models (GSP trees, accessibility indiices) for population to determine their actions when they have a need:
* Go to hospital / clinics
* Call for visiting nurses, case workers, caregivers
* Stay at home doing nothing
1. Calculate the corresponding cost (service call, transportation expense, personal feelings)
1. Optimize the resource allocation to minimize the cost.
