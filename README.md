## Phase I: Markov Model for patients' states
5 states: S L D H N
Consider Dual Eligible/Ineligible, and number of Comorbidities (1-3,4-7,8+)
Other factors to be confirmed
Using R to calculate probability again. (probability, rate)(model by AnyLogic)
## Phase II Build Patients Archetypes
Using N_Hats to build patients' archetypes. Sort High utilizers by good/bad habits.(Times to visit doctors from Claim?). Build high utilizer area data from census
